    "**Recap:** In mathematics, a graph is an object that consists of a set of vertices (nodes) connected with edges, i.e. $\\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$, where $V = \\{ v_i: i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N \\} \\}$ and $E \\subseteq \\{ (v_i, v_j):\\, v_i,v_j \\in V \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular graphs are a special class of graphs, where besides nodes (denoting atoms) and edges (denoting chemical bonds), we have an additional information about atom types and sometimes also bond types. We can assume that we have an additional set of node/atom features encoded as a matrix $X$, where $X_{ij}$ is the $j$-th feature of the $i$-th atom. As atomic features, we can have one-hot encoded atom symbols (a vector containing zeros on all positions besides the position that corresponds to the atom symbol), the number of implicit hydrogens bonded with this atom, or the number of heavy neighbors (atoms other than hydrogens bonded to the given atom).\n",
    "\n",
    "Egdes/bonds can be encoded in two different ways. One method is to use an adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij}=1$ if nodes/atoms $v_i$ nad $v_j$ are connected ($A_{ij}=0$ otherwise). In the case of sparse matrices, a more useful encoding is a list of pairs of connected atoms (a list of index pairs). This latter enocding is used by the PyTorch-Geometric library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a molecular graph can be described by two matrices: $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}$ and $E \\in \\{0, 1,\\dots,N-1\\}^{2 \\times N}$, where $N$ is the number of atoms, and $F$ is the number of atomic features.\n",

The <strong>atomic number</strong> of an atom signifies the number of protons in its nucleus, which determines its elemental identity and placement on the periodic table. <strong>Formal charge</strong> represents the charge assigned to an atom in a molecule or ion, calculated by considering the number of valence electrons and its bonding situation. <strong>Partial charge</strong> refers to the uneven distribution of electron density within a molecule, resulting in regions of slight positive or negative charge. <strong>Hybridization</strong> is a concept that describes the mixing of atomic orbitals to form hybrid orbitals, crucial for understanding molecular geometry and bonding patterns. These properties collectively influence an atom's reactivity, bonding behavior, and its role within chemical compounds, providing insight into the complex nature of molecular interactions.</p>\n",

Halogens, such as <strong>fluorine</strong>, <strong>chlorine</strong>, <strong>bromine</strong>, and <strong>iodine</strong>, are also commonly encountered in druglike compounds, where they can serve as substituents or functional groups, imparting specific chemical properties and influencing the compound's biological activity and metabolic stability.
